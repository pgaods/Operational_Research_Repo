    "   2. The amount of items packed in each bin cannot exceed its maximum capacity. \n",

    "In the OR scheduling problem, these 2 constraints can be translated as the following: each planned operation must be assigned at most one room (doctor cannot shift rooms during a single operation); in addition, the cumulative time of surgeries/operations within each operating room cannot exceed its maximum capacity. The maximum capacity is essentially defined as the maximum amount of minutes that can be used to perform these operations. Suppose we require that on each day, the operating room can function from 9:00am till 3:00pm. This way, the room has a maximum capacity of 6 hours ($6 \\times 60=360$ minutes). In reality, if we jam-pack 6 operations into one single room, we cannot implement such a plan because we have to set some time for cleaning and transition. We also have to consider that all the estimates of duration for each operation has some margin of error. So a realistic solution would be to set a utilization rate for each room (or a subset of all rooms). Let $ur$ define the utilization rate where its range is between 0 and 1. So this a hyperparameter that a scheduler can utilize. The higher the number, the more revenue the hospital can generate but it also runs the risk of all delays for subsequent operations. So there is a tradeoff certainly just like in an economic decisions made. So let's revise our maximum capacity. In the example, we will we will set the utilization rate to be 85%:"
